        <h2>the start.</h2>
        <p>Different backgrounds and miles apart couldn't keep this dynamic girl group from becoming the most popular new music on the scene. One year ago these girls didn't know each other, but their energy and musical talents made them quick friends. The inseparable group came out with their first hit "Hey Hey Hey" and never looked back.</p>
        <h2>today.</h2>
        <p>Massive Potential is working on their second album, "Girls". It is set to debut in January 2017. The girls have been working non-stop since their completely sold out world tour ended in June. Between cameos in the latest movies, red carpet appearances, and countless hours in the studio, they always find time for each other and their loyal fans.</p> 
        <h2>inspiration.</h2>
       <p>Massive Potential draws inspiration from all types of music. The girls each play at least two instruments and this makes their live shows unforgettable. From bluegrass to pop, the group is interested in all genres. They write each one of their songs and draw from personal experience. It's easy to see that these girls are passionate about their music and their friendship.
